                    You may know me from YouTube, GitHub or Discord, but this
                    is my website!  This contains all the projects that I work
                    on, along with links to my other social medias.  Plus, I
                    may make blog posts ever once in a while...

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="title is-3">Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't give much personal detail, but I will say this:
                    I am a freelance programmer that knows Python and
                    Javascript, can hold his own in C# and TypeScript, and
                    knows a smidgen of C/C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, if you fancy, I am a YouTube personality that mainly
                    makes short documentaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, you know me as that one person on your Twitter feed
                    that posts (hopefully) funny stuff every once in a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, the owner of the hangout server that you joined a while
                    ago and forgot about but didn't leave quite yet since you
                    <em>may</em> want to talk to one or two people in there.
                </p>
                <p>Either that or you're my friend and I forced you to come here.</p>
                <p>So hi.</p>

        <!-- What I'm working on -->
        <section class="section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="title is-3">What am I working on?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you saw the <a>Projects</a> section of the homepage or
                    the page, you should know that any of those with a green
                    label I'm currently working on.  But, there may be some
                    things that you may not know about, and aren't on my
                    project page such as videos or projects that may not see
                    the light of day.
                </p>
                <p>Anyways, here are some other projects of mine:</p>
            </div> 
            
            <!-- Discuss -->
            <div class='container pt-3'>
                <h3 class="title is-4">Discuss - Online Discussions</h3>
                <p>
                    A social media app that focuses on a Stackexchange-like
                    format of asking questions, giving answers or having
                    discussions about different subjects.  Currently, it's
                    stagnant because of the technical aspect of making it
                    look good, but it may see a resurface ever since I found
                    Bulma...
                </p>
                <p>Anyways, keep an eye on it.  You may see it on the projects page.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Dollarydoos -->
            <div class='container pt-3'>
                <h3 class='title is-4'>Dollarydoos</h3>
                <p>
                    Dollarydoos is a simple money tracker, which I'm still
                    working on in private.  Once I get the foundation done, I
                    will publisize it.  It will basically be a way to keep
                    track of your dollarydoos, wherever they are.  This app
                    will include budgets, funds, and accounts.  Budgets will
                    allow you to keep track on what you want to spend in
                    different categories and how much you can still spend in
                    those categories.  Funds will keep track of a goal for a
                    purchace, or set of purchaces.  To fulfill the goal, you
                    can move money from an account to the fund and will add
                    to the goal's fulfillment.  Accounts are containers for
                    your money which keep track of the changes in the ammounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep an eye out for this project, because I believe that it
                    should see a release or two.
