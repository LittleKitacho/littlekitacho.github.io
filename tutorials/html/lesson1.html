            <p id="description">HTML is the basic language that makes up all of your favorite websites.
                In fact, I created this website with HTML.  So, if you would like to build your own
                website, HTML is the way to go for a DIY option.</p>

            <h1 id="what_is_html">What is HTML?</h1>
                <p>HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language, and is the basic building block for
                    building websites.  All of the websites that you see today are built using
                    HTML.  HTML is simple to get the basics of, and you can be creating your
                    first website today!</p>
            <h1 id="getting_started">Getting Started</h1>
                <p>So, to get started, you need to have the following things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Code editor (anything will work)</li>
                    <li>Web browser (you can use the one you are using now)</li>
                    <li>A willingness to learn (need that anyways)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After you have those, you will be good to go.</p>
